An ambitious and resourceful English language teacher with almost 7 years of working experience willing to change my current path for more flexible and innovative profession of Front-end developer. My prior aim is to evolve as a person, to be an outstanding specimen who is able to convert his hard-working character into wealth and success.

The first decision that I made in order to gain new skills was enrolment on RS School's JS/Front-end Stage 1 course. Having done that I preliminarily finished JS/Front-end Stage 0 course independently - that was a great opportunity to submerge into the previously unknown and mysterious world of IT profession.

That's a new challenge for me, but I'm confident in stating that anything is possible - it may take much effort, literally kick you out from your comfort zone - but that'll be a real evolution.

**Personal advantages:**  
- Ambitious and perfectionist;  
- Unstoppable when it comes to attaining my objectives;  
- Patient and meticulous about anything I do.

**Personal disadvantages:**
